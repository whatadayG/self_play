- get verl running on its own
	[x] dependencies?
		- was a little hard-- uv venv was fine, but needed exactly py3.10 (note py version breaks ABI for wheels)
	- fix speed issues
	- GRPO
- figure out what to do about multiturn (i think nothing is needed, but look for an example reward fn?)
	[x] note examples/sglang_multiturn
	- try running qwen2.5-0.5b sglang multiturn example, find configs that work for sgland and not vllm
- try with LoRA instead
- see if you can port dialop env to match
	(env wise there are two ways you could do this-- you could install both verl stuff and dialop stuff or you could just import both in central scripts or you could put dialop stuff in verl)
		- refer to old repo in order to determine what's needed from dialop
	- dummy reward function
	- actual reward function
- self-play
